# Do you need to pickle your dice?
The dice I roll in a DnD session always feel, at least, like they're lower than they should be. I've developed a reputation among my fellow players for being unlucky - but I want to really know for sure. 

This app stores your rolls, plots them, and then compares them against some expected probabilities to see how unlucky you really are.
